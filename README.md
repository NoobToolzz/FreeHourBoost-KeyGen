## About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a very simple (and poorly coded) tool that attempts to bruteforce license keys for [FreeHourBoost](https://freehourboost.com), a freemium hour booster for Steam accounts.

PS: I haven't got a valid key and don't know if it redeems to my account or something. I cannot use username and password authentication as the login uses ReCaptcha.
